# Itead Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 USB dongle plus bootloader script
This script is a tool to activate the Bootloader of the Itead Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 USB dongle which is based on the CC2652P. It is provided by Itead itself and was just slightly improved by me. (Basically I just translated the chinese debug messages)

Further info how to use this script especially in regard how to reflash the firmware are described in the blog post linked below.
